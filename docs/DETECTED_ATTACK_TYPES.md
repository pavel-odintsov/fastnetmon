### We could detect really any attack targeted to channel overflow

But for very popular attack types we prepared algorithm which could give name for every attack of following type:
- `syn_flood`: TCP packets with enabled SYN flag
- `udp_flood`: flood with UDP packets (so recently in result of amplification)
- `icmp flood`: flood with ICMP packets
- `ip_fragmentation_flood`: IP packets with MF flag set or with non zero fragment offset
