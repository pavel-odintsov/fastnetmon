# Netflow v9 and IPFIX agents uses different and very complex approaches for notifying about sample ratio
# Here you could specify sampling ratio for all this agents
# For NetFLOW v5 we extract sampling ratio from packets directely and this option not used 
netflow_sampling_ratio = 1

# In some cases with NetFlow we could get huge bursts related to aggregated data nature
# We could try to get smoother data with this option, i.e. we will divide counters on collection interval time

# i.e. when we call attack_details script 
# Please disable exabgp_announce_host and exabgp_announce_whole_subnet if you want this feature
