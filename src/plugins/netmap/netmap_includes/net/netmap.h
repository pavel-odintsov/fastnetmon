 * For each "interface" (NIC, host stack, PIPE, VALE switch port) bound to
 * a file descriptor, the mmap()ed region contains a (logically readonly)
 * struct netmap_if pointing to struct netmap_ring's.
 *
 * There is one netmap_ring per physical NIC ring, plus one tx/rx ring
 * pair attached to the host stack (this pair is unused for non-NIC ports).
 *
 * All physical/host stack ports share the same memory region,
 * so that zero-copy can be implemented between them.
 * VALE switch ports instead have separate memory regions.
 *
 * The netmap_ring is the userspace-visible replica of the NIC ring.
 * Each slot has the index of a buffer (MTU-sized and residing in the
 * mmapped region), its length and some flags. An extra 64-bit pointer
 * is provided for user-supplied buffers in the tx path.
 *
 * In user space, the buffer address is computed as
 *	(char *)ring + buf_ofs + index * NETMAP_BUF_SIZE
 *
 * Added in NETMAP_API 11:
 *
 * + NIOCREGIF can request the allocation of extra spare buffers from
 *   the same memory pool. The desired number of buffers must be in
 *   nr_arg3. The ioctl may return fewer buffers, depending on memory
 *   availability. nr_arg3 will return the actual value, and, once
 *   mapped, nifp->ni_bufs_head will be the index of the first buffer.
 *
 *   The buffers are linked to each other using the first uint32_t
 *   as the index. On close, ni_bufs_head must point to the list of
 *   buffers to be released.
 *
 * + NIOCREGIF can request space for extra rings (and buffers)
 *   allocated in the same memory space. The number of extra rings
 *   is in nr_arg1, and is advisory. This is a no-op on NICs where
 *   the size of the memory space is fixed.
 *
 * + NIOCREGIF can attach to PIPE rings sharing the same memory
 *   space with a parent device. The ifname indicates the parent device,
 *   which must already exist. Flags in nr_flags indicate if we want to
 *   bind the master or slave side, the index (from nr_ringid)
 *   is just a cookie and does not need to be sequential.
 *
 * + NIOCREGIF can also attach to 'monitor' rings that replicate
 *   the content of specific rings, also from the same memory space.
 *
 *   Extra flags in nr_flags support the above functions.
 *   Application libraries may use the following naming scheme:
 *	netmap:foo			all NIC ring pairs
 *	netmap:foo^			only host ring pair
 *	netmap:foo+			all NIC ring + host ring pairs
 *	netmap:foo-k			the k-th NIC ring pair
 *	netmap:foo{k			PIPE ring pair k, master side
 *	netmap:foo}k			PIPE ring pair k, slave side

 * ioctl names and related fields
 *
 * NIOCTXSYNC, NIOCRXSYNC synchronize tx or rx queues,
 *	whose identity is set in NIOCREGIF through nr_ringid.
 *	These are non blocking and take no argument.
 *
 * NIOCGINFO takes a struct ifreq, the interface name is the input,
 *	the outputs are number of queues and number of descriptor
 *	for each queue (useful to set number of threads etc.).
 *	The info returned is only advisory and may change before
 *	the interface is bound to a file descriptor.
 *
 * NIOCREGIF takes an interface name within a struct nmre,
 *	and activates netmap mode on the interface (if possible).
 *
 * The argument to NIOCGINFO/NIOCREGIF overlays struct ifreq so we
 * can pass it down to other NIC-related ioctls.
 *
 * The actual argument (struct nmreq) has a number of options to request
 * different functions.
 * The following are used in NIOCREGIF when nr_cmd == 0:
 *
 * nr_name	(in)
 *	The name of the port (em0, valeXXX:YYY, etc.)
 *	limited to IFNAMSIZ for backward compatibility.
 *
 * nr_version	(in/out)
 *	Must match NETMAP_API as used in the kernel, error otherwise.
 *	Always returns the desired value on output.
 *
 * nr_tx_slots, nr_tx_slots, nr_tx_rings, nr_rx_rings (in/out)
 *	On input, non-zero values may be used to reconfigure the port
 *	according to the requested values, but this is not guaranteed.
 *	On output the actual values in use are reported.
 *
 * nr_ringid (in)
 *	Indicates how rings should be bound to the file descriptors.
 *	If nr_flags != 0, then the low bits (in NETMAP_RING_MASK)
 *	are used to indicate the ring number, and nr_flags specifies
 *	the actual rings to bind. NETMAP_NO_TX_POLL is unaffected.
 *
 *	NOTE: THE FOLLOWING (nr_flags == 0) IS DEPRECATED:
 *	If nr_flags == 0, NETMAP_HW_RING and NETMAP_SW_RING control
 *	the binding as follows:
 *	0 (default)			binds all physical rings
 *	NETMAP_HW_RING | ring number	binds a single ring pair
 *	NETMAP_SW_RING			binds only the host tx/rx rings
 *
 *	NETMAP_NO_TX_POLL can be OR-ed to make select()/poll() push
 *		packets on tx rings only if POLLOUT is set.
 *		The default is to push any pending packet.
 *
 *	NETMAP_DO_RX_POLL can be OR-ed to make select()/poll() release
 *		packets on rx rings also when POLLIN is NOT set.
 *		The default is to touch the rx ring only with POLLIN.
 *		Note that this is the opposite of TX because it
 *		reflects the common usage.
 *
 *	NOTE: NETMAP_PRIV_MEM IS DEPRECATED, use nr_arg2 instead.
 *	NETMAP_PRIV_MEM is set on return for ports that do not use
 *		the global memory allocator.
 *		This information is not significant and applications
 *		should look at the region id in nr_arg2
 *
 * nr_flags	is the recommended mode to indicate which rings should
 *		be bound to a file descriptor. Values are NR_REG_*
 *
 * nr_arg1 (in)	The number of extra rings to be reserved.
 *		Especially when allocating a VALE port the system only
 *		allocates the amount of memory needed for the port.
 *		If more shared memory rings are desired (e.g. for pipes),
 *		the first invocation for the same basename/allocator
 *		should specify a suitable number. Memory cannot be
 *		extended after the first allocation without closing
 *		all ports on the same region.
 *
 * nr_arg2 (in/out) The identity of the memory region used.
 *		On input, 0 means the system decides autonomously,
 *		other values may try to select a specific region.
 *		On return the actual value is reported.
 *		Region '1' is the global allocator, normally shared
 *		by all interfaces. Other values are private regions.
 *		If two ports the same region zero-copy is possible.
 *
 * nr_arg3 (in/out)	number of extra buffers to be allocated.
 *
 *
 *
 * nr_cmd (in)	if non-zero indicates a special command:
 *	NETMAP_BDG_ATTACH	 and nr_name = vale*:ifname
 *		attaches the NIC to the switch; nr_ringid specifies
 *		which rings to use. Used by vale-ctl -a ...
 *	    nr_arg1 = NETMAP_BDG_HOST also attaches the host port
 *		as in vale-ctl -h ...
 *
 *	NETMAP_BDG_DETACH	and nr_name = vale*:ifname
 *		disconnects a previously attached NIC.
 *		Used by vale-ctl -d ...
 *
 *	NETMAP_BDG_LIST
 *		list the configuration of VALE switches.
 *
 *	NETMAP_BDG_VNET_HDR
 *		Set the virtio-net header length used by the client
 *		of a VALE switch port.
 *
